* org-recent-headings

This package lets you quickly jump to recently used Org headings using Helm, Ivy, or plain-ol' =completing-read=.

* Installation

Install from MELPA and run =org-recent-headings-mode=.  You may also install Helm and/or Ivy, but they aren't required.

To install manually, put =org-recent-headings.el= in your =load-path=, =(require 'org-recent-headings)= in your init file, and run =org-recent-headings-mode=.

You'll probably want to call =org-recent-headings-mode= in your init file to activate it automatically

* Usage

When =org-recent-headings-mode= is active, whenever you jump to an Org heading (e.g. in the Agenda, with =helm-org-rifle=, or with any function listed in =org-recent-headings-advise-functions=), the heading you jump to will be added to =org-recent-headings-list=.  Then you can jump to those headings with any of these commands:

+ =org-recent-headings=
+ =org-recent-headings-helm=
+ =org-recent-headings-ivy=

If you use Helm, you can add =org-recent-headings--helm-source= (as a function call, not a variable) to the sources of any Helm command, e.g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (helm :sources (org-recent-headings--helm-source))

  (helm-other-buffer (list helm-source-buffers-list
                           (org-recent-headings--helm-source))
                     "My Helm command")
#+END_SRC

You may customize the =org-recent-headings= group if you like.

* Development

Bug reports, suggestions, feedback â€” /oh my/! 

Suggestions for functions to add to =org-recent-headings-advise-functions= are especially welcome.  I'd like the default to be as useful as possible.

GPLv3 or any later version.
