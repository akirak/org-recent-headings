[[https://melpa.org/#/org-recent-headings][file:https://melpa.org/packages/org-recent-headings-badge.svg]] [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/org-recent-headings][file:https://stable.melpa.org/packages/org-recent-headings-badge.svg]]

This package lets you quickly jump to recently used Org headings using Helm, Ivy, or plain-ol' =completing-read=.

* Installation

Install from MELPA and put this in your init file (using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package org-recent-headings
    :config (org-recent-headings-mode))
#+END_SRC

You may also install Helm and/or Ivy, but they aren't required.

To install manually, put =org-recent-headings.el= in your =load-path=, and put this in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'org-recent-headings)
  (org-recent-headings-mode)
#+END_SRC

* Usage

When =org-recent-headings-mode= is active, whenever you jump to an Org heading (e.g. in the Agenda, with =helm-org-rifle=, or with any function listed in =org-recent-headings-advise-functions=), the heading you jump to will be added to =org-recent-headings-list=.  Then you can jump to those headings with any of these commands:

+  =org-recent-headings=
+  =org-recent-headings-helm=
+  =org-recent-headings-ivy=

** Customization

The =org-recent-headings-advise-functions= list has several commonly used functions, but users will likely want to customize this list.  You might want to add functions to it, like =isearch= functions, [[https://github.com/abo-abo/worf][Worf]] functions, or commands from other packages you may use.  (Suggestions for the default list of functions are welcome!)

=org-recent-headings-show-entry-function= lets you choose the default way to jump to headings, either in their real buffer, or in an indirect, narrowed buffer (with =org-tree-to-indirect-buffer=).

There are a few other settings as well.  Customize the =org-recent-headings= group to see them all.

** Helm

If you use Helm, you can add =helm-source-org-recent-headings= to the sources of any Helm command, e.g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (helm :sources helm-source-org-recent-headings)

  (helm-other-buffer (list helm-source-buffers-list
                           helm-source-org-recent-headings)
                     "My Helm command")
#+END_SRC

* Changelog

** 0.2-pre

*Added*
+  Variable ~org-recent-headings-reject-any-fns~ may be a list of functions used to test new entries; if any return non-nil, an entry is not saved to the recent headings list.  This may be used to e.g. only save entries from certain directories by using a function like:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (lambda (entry)
    (not (string-match (rx-to-string `(seq bos ,(expand-file-name "~/org/")) t)
                       (org-recent-headings-entry-file entry))))
#+END_SRC

*Fixed*
+  Storing entries from indirect buffers.

*Changed*
+  Entries are now stored as structs.  The list should be automatically converted to the new format.

** 0.1

First tagged release, almost 2 years since first commit.

* Development

Bug reports, suggestions, feedback â€” /oh my/! 

Suggestions for functions to add to =org-recent-headings-advise-functions= are especially welcome.  I'd like the default to be as useful as possible.
